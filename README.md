# Microbial metagenomes from Lake Soyang
This repository contains R scripts and processed data used for generating figures in the manuscript _"Microbial metagenomes from Lake Soyang, the largest freshwater reservoir in South Korea"_, currently under review at _Scientific Data_.

All R scripts are provided under the `Fig2/` directory. The input files were generated through a standard bioinformatics workflow, briefly described below.

## Taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads

This section describes the commands used for:

- Adapter and quality trimming  
- Removal of phiX contamination  
- Taxonomic classification

### 1. Adapter trimming and quality filtering with `BBDuk`

```bash bbduk.sh in1=sample_1.fq.gz in2=sample_2.fq.gz \
out1=sample_trimmed_1.fq.gz out2=sample_trimmed_2.fq.gz \
ref=adapters.fa ktrim=r k=23 mink=11 hdist=1 tpe tbo \
qtrim=rl trimq=10 ftm=5 minlen=100```

### 2. Removal of phiX reads

```bash bbduk.sh in1=sample_trimmed_1.fq.gz in2=sample_trimmed_2.fq.gz \
out1=sample_clean_1.fq.gz out2=sample_clean_2.fq.gz \
ref=phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz k=31 hdist=1```

### 3. Taxonomic classification with `Kraken2` (using GTDB R207 via `Struo2`)

```bash kraken2 --db /path/to/struo2_GTDBR207/ \
--paired --gzip-compressed \
--output sample.kraken --report sample.kraken.report \
sample_clean_1.fq.gz sample_clean_2.fq.gz```

### 4. Visualization

Taxonomic composition was visualized based on `sample.kraken.report` files generated by `Kraken2`. These report files were processed into abundance tables, which were then used to create bubble plots in `R`. The R script used for plotting, along with all input and processed files, is provided in the `Fig2/` directory of this repository.
